## Ethereum Go (ORIGINAL BLOCKCHAIN)


#### Repository Notice
**PROJECT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AT 
https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum**

The **Ethereum Classic** project is set to be moved to this namespace, however until further notice,
please use the above repository and the issues page on the above
repository. Sorry for the inconvience, this project was started before I
joined the Ethereum Classic team. Ethereum is now a truly decentralized
project now, and as a consequence we are still in the process of organizing ourselves.

**The above client is the first working 1.40.1 classic/original chain client. It requires no additional flags, and all the unnecessary DAO code is removed with the exception of 1 new line to reject the hard fork block at 1920000 utilizing an existing feature of the client. This client will be kept up to date with upstream without hard for code.**



#### Project Details

*Migration in progress, this master has all the DAO specific hardcoding removed and can successfully build all binaries but much of the documentation is derived from the forked version of Ethereum and needs to be updated. If you have any issues please create an issue*

Official golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol supporting the
original chain. A version which can **honestly** offer both a censorship
resistant and unstoppable application platform for developers.

This is a project migrated from the now hard forked Ethereum (ETHHF or ETHF) github project, we
will need to slowly migrate peices of the infrastructure required to
maintain the project. We will apply all upstream patches unrelated to the DAO HF while organizing
development.

Comments are being made in the codebase with the tag !EPROJECT
recommending actions that must be taken to help complete the migration.

For example, the links below are to build.ethdev.com, we will need our
own build/status continuous development setup in order for it to work
properly.
